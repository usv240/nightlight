"""Subtitle the finished cut, then burn the captions in.

    python subtitle.py

Cues come from `cues.json`, which records where each beat truly landed
after the dead air was removed. Generating them from the plan instead
would put every cue a few seconds out by the third beat.

Splitting
---------
A beat is ten to twenty seconds of speech and is unreadable as one
subtitle. Each is split at sentence boundaries and the beat's speaking
time shared between the cues in proportion to their length. Frame-accurate
word alignment is not needed: every cue starts and ends on a real sentence
boundary, and the error inside a sentence is tenths of a second.

One line per cue, never two, at most 58 characters. A second line is a
second thing to find with your eyes while something is happening on
screen. A sentence longer than that is split on a clause boundary, and
only on whitespace if it has no commas to give.

The opening and the sign-off are subtitled like everything else. A muted
viewer should get "Hi everyone, I am Ujwal." and "Thank you.", not just
the middle.

Gotcha
------
ffmpeg's subtitles filter parses its own argument string, so a Windows
path containing a drive colon breaks the parse. The .srt is copied next to
the video and passed as a bare filename from that working directory.
